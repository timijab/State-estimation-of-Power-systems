# State-estimation-of-Power-systems
State Estimation program that estimates core power values e.g Power injections, real and reactive power on each bus, power flow results and so much more.
This project was carried out with the understanding that making decisions in power systems based on only raw measurement data of the system will give a misinterpreation of the system.
Therefore, there is a need to successfully estimate the operating conditions of a power system to be able to control, maintain and observe its behaviour.
This was developed within the matlab programming framework.
